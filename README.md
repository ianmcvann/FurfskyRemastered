# FurfSky Remastered: Blue Overlay

This pack attempts to recreate the blue overlay from FurfSky Reborn 1.8.9 in 1.21.5 for Hypixel Skyblock. 

Almost nothing is implemented, but the pack is still usable and fixes some UIs. 

## Installation
1. Download FurfSky 1.21.5. (And install the required mods - Firmament and Optifine)
1. Download this repo. The repo zip is the pack. 
2. Place both packs in your `resourcepacks` folder.
3. Open Minecraft and go to `Options > Resource Packs`.
4. Select both packs and click `Done`. **ENSURE THAT FURFSKY 1.21.5 IS BELOW THIS PACK!**
5. Enjoy!

## Optional but highly recommended

Since many of the menus are not implemented, you may want to use [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/default-dark-mode) alongside this pack. I think it looks way better. If you do, be sure that this pack is still above it. 

## Includes:
- Inventory
- Chocolate Factory
- Collections Menu(s)
- Skill Menu(s)
- Skyblock Menu

## Known Issues
- Some menus are not implemented

## Credits
- [FurfSky Reborn](https://furfsky.net/) for the original pack (and all independent artist contributors)

I am not an artist, or a texture pack creator. Odds are some menus don't look right, or some textures are missing. If you want to help, feel free to open an issue or pull request and I'll take a look at it.
